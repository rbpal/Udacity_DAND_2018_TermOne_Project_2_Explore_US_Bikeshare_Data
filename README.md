# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Term One
## Project Two Title : Explore US Bikeshare Data
In this project, I wrote Python code to import US bike share data and answer questions about data by computing descriptive statistics. Python script takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## CSV Dataset Files
CSV dataset files were provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States. We compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. CSV files used in project are as under
- chicago.csv  
- new_york_city.csv 
- washington.csv 

## Python Script usage
